  * Up to now, the plugin probably only works for incoming calls!

  * apply the sed patch with sh prepare_linphone_for_g722.sh <path-to-linphone-sources>

  * prepare with ./autogen.sh
  * compile msg722 with ./configure && make && make install

  * we only need to apply one more patch in this version, the filter is now registered correctly with the
  	help of Linphone library functions
  * in coreapi/sal_eXosip2_sdp.c there's the line: "pt->clock_rate=atoi(p);" which has to be changed to
  	"pt->clock_rate = (!strcasecmp(mime,"G722") ? 16000 : atoi(p));"
